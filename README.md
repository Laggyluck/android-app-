# api calls android

This application is made in Android Studio. It uses Volley library to communicate with api that I have made and hosted on VPS.
I have made this application to develop my skill in Android Studio.

In this application u can: Sign up, log in, add, edit, delete and see all your posts. In future I'm gonna add a possibility
to see other users' posts and add possibility to vote up or down for posts.
